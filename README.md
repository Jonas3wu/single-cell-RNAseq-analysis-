# Public Data Acknowledgment

The scRNA-seq datasets SRR23934263 and SRR23934264 correspond to baseline (diagnosis-stage) bone marrow samples from AML patients. These data were obtained from the GEO dataset GSE227903 and downloaded using the SRA Toolkit, after which reads were split into paired FASTQ files for downstream processing.
